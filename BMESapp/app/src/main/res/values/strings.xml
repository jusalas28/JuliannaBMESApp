    <string name="about_us_txt">This society is an official chapter (Ch. #40) of the national Biomedical Engineering Society. With
our Jesuit institution\'s core, we aim to unite and promote the future of biomedical engineering
through an emphasis on health innovation and scientific advancement for the globally
underprivileged and neglected. Through servant leadership, BMES shall encourage student
integrity, provide vocational guidance, and promote student pioneers. Through collaborative,
hands-on experiences in medical instrument limitation, clinical solution proposals, and critical
analysis, students will develop qualities and virtues vital for not only a successful career but for
the betterment of society.</string>

    <string name="news_outreach"> Biomed Bootcamp allows student members of BMES to inspire children from underrepresented backgrounds
    to pursue STEM careers. Our members teach younger students how to construct Raspberry Pi units and
    explain their functionality. Thanks to this effort, students who normally do not get much STEM exposure get to
    learn basic engineering principles and improve their teamwork skills. On top of that, they get to take home
    the Raspberry Pi units they built. Because of the financial situation of many of these students, it\'s
    important that the cost of these kits be covered by BMES through our fund raising, rather than by the school or students. Our students are
    involved with this in teaching the actual content and in assisting students with these
        concepts. </string>

    <string name="news_awards"> In this formal event,
BMES recognizes the hard work all members have put in during the academic year and highlights some
students who went above and beyond to improve themselves and BMES. Alumni and Industry Professionals
have the opportunity to network with students from the Opus College of
Engineering and make an impression on BMES students. This event hosts current
students, esteemed faculty, the Dean of the Opus College of Engineering, and industry
professionals. Our industry partners get special recognition! This will include a logo in the
“sponsored by” section of the invitation, a special display area in the venue, and special mention
during executive board remarks. </string>
